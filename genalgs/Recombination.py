class Recombination(Microbial):
    """ A Genetic Algorithm using Localized Tournament Selection, variable methods of genetic crossover, child class
    of Microbial. This class was created to explore different kinds of recombination techniques.

        Algorithm Methodology:
            1. Choose at random two individuals from the same deme (local "neighborhood")
            2. Compare the fitness of the individuals, and assign one winner and one loser
            3. Three options for genetic crossover: (1) single-point crossover, (2) two-point crossover, (3) uniform
            crossover
            4. With some probability, mutate the loser through a random bit flip or small percentage deviation, based
            on encoding type

        For inherited attributes and methods, refer to the Microbial and GeneticAlgorithm class documentation.
